## Customization

### Response System
The chatbot uses a keyword-based response system. You can customize responses by modifying the `generateResponse()` function in `chatbot.js`.

### Styling
All visual aspects can be customized through `chatbot.css`. The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming.

### Internationalization
The chatbot supports i18n through the global `i18n` object. Make sure your translation files include the following keys:

```json
{
  "chatbot": {
    "title": "Medical Assistant",
    "welcome": {
      "message": "Hello! Welcome to Adam International Hospital. How can I assist you today?"
    },
    "messages": {
      "appointment_response": "I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment!",
      "treatments_response": "We offer comprehensive fertility treatments...",
      "locations_response": "Adam International Hospital has multiple locations...",
      "contact_response": "You can reach us at 16992...",
      "default_response": "Thank you for your message!"
    },
    "quick_actions": {
      "appointment": "Book Appointment",
      "treatments": "Treatments",
      "locations": "Locations",
      "contact": "Contact"
    },
    "input": {
      "placeholder": "Type your message..."
    }
  }
}
```
